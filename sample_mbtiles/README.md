# Description
With the product [TopPlusOpen](http://www.geodatenzentrum.de/geodaten/gdz_rahmen.gdz_div?gdz_spr=eng&gdz_akt_zeile=5&gdz_anz_zeile=1&gdz_unt_zeile=41&gdz_user_id=0) (TPO), the BKG breaks new grounds and creates for the first time a consistent web map, completely based on free and official data sources. For this purpose, the BKG merged, processed and combined many different data sources in order to achieve the best possible map presentation. Among others, free official spatial data of the Federal Government and the Open Data states Berlin, Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Thuringia are presented in the product. Furthermore, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Rhineland-Palatinate provide their official spatial data for the TPO based on a cooperation agreement so that also these states are presented exclusively by official data. 

The web map TopPlusOpen has 18 levels of detail – from the worldwide overview map to the detailed city map in Germany. As standard, the product is available in the widespread Web Mercator Projection (EPSG:3857). The web map is divided into three different display areas:
* World (small scale)
* Europe (medium scale)
* Germany and neighboring countries (large scale)

The tile archive of the TopPlusOpen you may download [here](https://daten.gdz.bkg.bund.de/produkte/topplus_open/TopPlusOpen/aktuell/) in the form of SQLite databases in the mbtile format for the single zoom levels (data volume 940 GB).
